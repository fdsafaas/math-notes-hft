\chapter {Mathematical Induction}
It's simpler to prove recurrence relations using mathematical induction.

Mathematical induction is a general way to prove that some statement about the integer $n$ is true for all $n > n_0$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First we prove the statement when $n$ has its smallest value, $n_0$; this is called the basis.
	\item Then we prove the statement for $n > n_0$, assuming that it has already been proved for all values in $ [n_0, n - 1]$, this is called the induction. Such a proof gives infinitely many results with only a finite amount of work.
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Mathematical induction proves that we can climb as high as we like on a ladder, by proving that we can climb onto the bottom rung (the basis) and that from each rung we can climb up to the next one (the induction).}
