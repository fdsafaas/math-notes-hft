# Math notes for HFT

I started out in HFT as a pure software engineer and then transitioned to a Quant Dev. During the transition, I had to learn advanced maths. This repo is more like a notebook of all the topics I needed.

HFT industry is stressful but rewarding. Studying and constantly improving yourself can take a toll on your mental health and pandemic is just the cherry on top. I was lucky to have support of Aliza Joshi. Without her I wont have made the transition.
